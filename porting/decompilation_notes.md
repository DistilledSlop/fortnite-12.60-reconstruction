# Decompilation notes: quality of the Athena target set

Scope: the 908 ranked targets in `porting/generated/reflection/decompile_targets.json` (section 10 of
`binary_analysis.md`), decompiled by `porting/ghidra/decompile_targets.py` from the slim project
`fortnite-slim`. Output is git-ignored under `porting/generated/decomp/` (853 `.c` files and `index.json`).
The raw code is derived from the user's supplied client and is not reproduced here beyond short excerpts.

## Run results [observed]

| Tier | Meaning | Targets | ok | timeout | failed | skipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FUNC_Net (RPC / replicated) | 182 | 182 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | FUNC_Native + BlueprintEvent | 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | BlueprintCallable with exec | 436 | 436 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | other native with exec | 228 | 228 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | no exec address | 55 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 55 |
| **Total** | | **908** | **853** | **0** | **0** | **55** |

- The wall time for all 908 was about 32 s (sequential, JVM start included). No function hit the 30 s timeout.
- 266 functions had no Ghidra function at their exec address (not covered by `.pdata`). They were created in
  memory with `--create-missing`. The creation and every rename ran inside one transaction that was rolled back.
- Opening the project rewrote five bookkeeping files (`idata/~index.bak`, `idata/~index.dat`,
  `versioned/~index.bak`, `versioned/~index.dat`, `project.prp`). The program database was not written.
- Nothing was saved. The probe run and every later run reported the same five files, and no others.
- 39 targets share 10 code addresses (the linker most likely folded identical bodies, e.g. empty stubs). The index is keyed by class and function for this reason.

## Sample review: 15 functions [observed; judgment is the author's]

| # | Function | Kind | Lines | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AFortPawn.GetLocalSpin` | getter (T3) | 10 | **Yes.** Needs the `+0x638` field name and the return type. |
| 2 | `AFortPawn.ServerTeleportNearLocation` | Server RPC with `_Validate` | 32 | **Yes.** Validate and implementation slots are clear (see excerpt B). |
| 3 | `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.ServerSetTeam` | Server RPC with `_Validate` | 26 | **Yes.** Same shape as #2. |
| 4 | `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.ServerSetOnCreativePortalLoadedDelegate` | Server RPC, one vtable call | 20 | **Yes**, once slot `0x25e8` is named. |
| 5 | `AFortPlayerStateAthena.ClientNotifyMatchEntered` | Client RPC, two FFrame reads | 36 | Partial: the reads and the slot call (`0x868`) need names. |
| 6 | `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.ClientAutoEquipFirstItem` | Client RPC, struct + bool | 39 | Partial: struct parameter type unknown. |
| 7 | `AFortPlayerStateAthena.ClientAddKillFeedErrorMessage` | Client RPC, TArray of ref-counted items | 59 | Partial: the array-release loop is hard to read by hand. |
| 8 | `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.ClientBroadcastOnUpdateCreativePlotName` | Client RPC, FString + bool | 54 | Partial: FString and ref-count release are unnamed. |
| 9 | `AFortPlayerPawn.ClientNotifyAbilityFailed` | Client RPC, GAS-related | 38 | Partial: the target slot `0xf98` is unnamed. |
| 10 | `AFortPlayerPawn.ClientResetAbilitySystemComponent` | thunk, tail jump through vtable | 12 | Partial: "Treating indirect jump as call". The target is unknown. |
| 11 | `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.ServerAddSimulatedXp` | Server RPC with FString | 68 | Partial (skimmed, top half read). |
| 12 | `AFortPawn.NetMulticast_InvokeGameplayCueAdded` | multicast, GAS cue parameters | 84 | **No.** Stack struct built from a static pointer; needs the cue-parameter layout. |
| 13 | `AFortPlayerPawn.HandleInStasis` | the only `switch` | 105 | **No.** Jump table not recovered; an `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER_140000000` expression is junk. |
| 14 | `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.PublishCreativePlot` | long Server RPC | 244 | **No.** Stack-struct copy noise. |
| 15 | `AFortPlayerStateAthena.OnRep_DeathInfo` | OnRep, large (tier 4) | 1717 | **No.** Needs struct layouts and helper names throughout. |

Verdict: **4 of 15 are portable by hand now** (getter, two validated RPCs, and the single-call RPC once its slot is named). Seven need a
few names (vtable slots, FFrame helpers, a struct type). Four are not usable as a port guide. Across
all 853 files: 273 of 436 tier-3 functions and 70 of 182 tier-1 functions are 20 lines or fewer, so
the short wrapper-type functions are where this pays off.

## Recurring noise [observed counts across the 853 files]

- **FFrame argument fetch.** `FUN_142ed9cf0` and `FUN_142ed9d20`, 667 call sites each. Each RPC and
  BlueprintCallable wrapper uses them to read every parameter from the script frame, with the
  `*(param_2 + 0x20) == 0` test repeated per parameter. Naming these two would clear a large share of every RPC wrapper.
- **Vtable calls.** `(**(code **)(*param_1 + 0x...))`: 997 call sites in 391 files, 454 distinct offsets.
  The most common are 0x150 (57), 0x38 (25) and 0x10 (24), which are base-class virtuals; the rest are spread out, including the high RPC slots.
- **`FUN_142bee710`**, 410 call sites in 123 files, always after a null test on a pointer. Probably `FMemory::Free` (unverified).
- **`FUN_142d6e0f0(L"<Function>_Validate")`**, 96 sites. The validation-failure reporter (checkf/ensure-style, unverified).
- **Ref-count release loops** (`LOCK()`/`UNLOCK()`), 161 sites in 28 files: TSharedRef/TRefCountPtr releases, inlined.
- **Untyped locals and parameters.** `param_N` 11,724 uses, `undefined*` 6,607, `longlong *` casts 4,309,
  stack locals (`uStack_`, `alStack_`, `plStack_`) 10,194. Most RPC prototypes are `(longlong *, longlong)`.
- **Switch and jump tables.** One `switch` recovered in the whole set. The rest appear as `goto` / `LAB_` labels (235 in 50 files).
  Warnings "Could not recover jumptable" appear where the decompiler gives up.
- **Thunk tail calls** shown as calls, and **identical code under different names** (39 targets share 10 bodies).
- **Strings.** Literals resolve. Defined string data is tried first (`StringDataInstance`). Undefined ASCII and UTF-16
  literals are read from memory, because the slim project has the ASCII strings analyzer off. Only 96 distinct literals
  appear, all `*_Validate` names. No log or UFunction strings are referenced directly by these 853 bodies.

## Symbol pass [observed]

`--rename` names each native exec function `Class_Function` from `native_funcs.json` (16,389 renamed,
4,185 not applied because no function object exists there). Before/after on two functions:

- `AFortPlayerPawn.ClientNotifyAbilityFailed`: the function name changes from `FUN_142a7b220` to `AFortPlayerPawn_ClientNotifyAbilityFailed`. The body is identical.
- `AFortPlayerControllerAthena.ClientAutoEquipFirstItem`: the name changes from `FUN_142a56690` to `AFortPlayerControllerAthena_ClientAutoEquipFirstItem`. The body is identical.

Zero of the 353 distinct direct callees of the 853 functions are UFUNCTION exec addresses, so renaming
resolves no callees. The gain is the function's own name, nothing more.

## Excerpts (raw output, then the C++ I would write)

**A. Getter.** Raw (`AFortPawn::GetLocalSpin`):
```c
*(ulonglong *)(param_2 + 0x20) = (ulonglong)(*(longlong *)(param_2 + 0x20) != 0) + *(longlong *)(param_2 + 0x20);
*param_3 = *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0x638);
```
C++ (the first line is `P_FINISH`, which I read as `Stack.Code += !!Stack.Code`; unverified against the 4.25 macros):
```cpp
void AFortPawn::execGetLocalSpin(UObject* Context, FFrame& Stack, void* const Result) {
    P_FINISH;
    *(float*)Result = LocalSpin;   // LocalSpin at +0x638 (name and type need the layout)
}
```

**B. Validated Server RPC.** Raw (`AFortPawn::ServerTeleportNearLocation`):
```c
cVar1 = (**(code **)(*param_1 + 0x8d0))(param_1,&uStack_18);
if (cVar1 == '\0') {
  FUN_142d6e0f0(L"ServerTeleportNearLocation_Validate");
  return;
}
(**(code **)(*param_1 + 0x8d8))(param_1,&uStack_18);
```
C++:
```cpp
// params read from Stack by the FFrame helpers, then:
if (!ServerTeleportNearLocation_Validate(Params)) {   // vtable slot 0x8d0 / 8 = 282
    checkf(false, TEXT("ServerTeleportNearLocation_Validate"));   // FUN_142d6e0f0: reporter, guessed checkf/ensure
    return;
}
ServerTeleportNearLocation_Implementation(Params);    // vtable slot 0x8d8 / 8 = 283
```

**C. Client RPC with a call through the vtable.** Renamed output (`AFortPlayerPawn_ClientNotifyAbilityFailed`):
```c
(**(code **)(*param_1 + 0xf98))(param_1,uStackX_8,alStack_28);
```
C++ (types unknown: `uStackX_8` is an 8-byte value, `alStack_28` a 32-byte struct):
```cpp
ClientNotifyAbilityFailed_Implementation(AbilityHandle, Reason);   // vtable slot 0xf98 / 8 = 499
```

## Vtable slot numbers the thunks give [observed]

A tier-1 thunk calls `(*this + off)`. For a validated RPC the call sequence is validate, then
implementation at the next slot. For a Client or Multicast RPC there is one call, to the implementation.
Examples (slots in the class's own table, from the constructor vtables in `binary_analysis.md` section 10):

- `AFortPlayerStateAthena` (table `0x145e35fa8`): ClientNotifyMatchEntered 269, ClientReportDBNO 270,
  ClientReportTeamKill 271, ClientReportKill 272, Client_OnNewLevel 273, ClientAddKillFeedErrorMessage 276.
  Server_TogglePreserveSquad 267/268 (validate/impl). Server_SetCanEditCreativeIsland 274/275.
- `AFortPlayerPawnAthena` (table `0x145e2cfd0`): NetMulticast_SuccessfulBuildingEdit 639, ServerSuicide 640/641,
  ServerCreativeToggleGhost 636/637, FastSharedReplication 642, ServerSetInteractingItem 643/644.

These are inferred from call sites. Check each against the implementation target before use.

## What is missing to make this portable

1. **Vtable slot names.** The first 30 slots of both Athena tables are base-class virtuals with no UFUNCTION match
   (20 distinct targets; 13 of the 30 slots point to three shared stubs). The RPC slots above are the only names available. The
   base slots need UObject, AActor and APlayerState declaration order from matching engine headers.
2. **Identities of the helpers.** `FUN_142ed9cf0` / `FUN_142ed9d20` (FFrame step), `FUN_142d6e0f0`
   (validate reporter), `FUN_142bee710` (free), `FUN_142c0c240` (FString init, unverified). A UE 4.25 build would
   let these be matched by their string literals and call shapes.
3. **Struct layouts.** `FVector`, `FItem`, `FGameplayCueParameters`, `FDeathInfo`, and the creative structs. These are in
   the recovered struct tables (section 9); the decompiler does not use them yet.
4. **Prototypes.** The decompiler has no UFunction parameter types. Setting prototypes from `function_blocks.json`
   before decompiling would replace `longlong *`/`undefined*` with real types.
5. **Switch recovery.** Decompiler switch analysis is off in the slim project. Re-enabling it only for the few
   functions that need it, or decoding jump tables by hand, is needed for `HandleInStasis`-type code.

## Method notes

- `porting/ghidra/decompile_targets.py` opens the project without saving. Created functions and renames are
  rolled back with `endTransaction(tx, False)`. The run reports any project file that changed on disk.
- Output: `porting/generated/decomp/<Class>/<Function>.c` with a header (class, function, tier, address,
  flags, net roles) and `porting/generated/decomp/index.json` (status, line count, direct and indirect calls,
  string literals).
